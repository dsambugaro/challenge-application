# Challenge

This project is a simple asset manager with supports companies, units, and users. It was made to explore [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Ant Design](https://ant.design), and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com).

Although there is much to be improved, its main features are:
- Rest API with JWT authentication
- Different levels of summaries about the assets
- A very base Role-Based Access Control

To run the code follow instructions in `server` and `client` folders.
